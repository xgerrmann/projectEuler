# A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# >> Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#999999
#998899
#997799
#ETC
# For each such number / candidate, check if it is the product of two 3-digit integers.

# So check for 100 to 999

# Since there are (it seems) less candidates than possibilities of possibilities of
# multiplying 2 3-digit integers I will start with the candidates.

# First attempt failed: 100001
# Second attempt succesfull.
